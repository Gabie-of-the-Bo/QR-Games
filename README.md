# QR Games
As you may have guessed, this is just another one of <i>those</i> sites (not very profound, not that they intend to in any way). <b>QRGames</b> allows
you to code small JavaScript games using an internal "framework" (using a generous nomenclature) and to share them using QR codes. These would contain
<b>all the game's code</b> by means of minification and compression, so no server is necessary to either store the code nor to run it.
